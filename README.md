An anticheat solution for Arcuno Network. 

This is the first custom anticheat I’ve ever coded. Through building it, I was able to write many custom checks and learn a lot about the game. Now that I’ve reached a point where I can write some more “advanced” checks, I’ve decided to open-source this first version.

Note: This depends on my custom fork, AetherSpigot, which you can find here: [AetherSpigot](https://drvsz/AetherSpigot)
